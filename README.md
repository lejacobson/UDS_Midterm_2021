# Midterm Exam for Duke Unifying Data Science 2021

In this repo, you will find three jupyter notebooks (labeled `_part1`, `_part2` and `_part3`). 

For your midterm, please complete all three of these parts and submit them (as PDFs) to gradescope before the midterm due date, Saturday March 6th at 5pm. 

The deadline is 5pm SUNDAY CHINESE TIME for our two students in China.

These exams are open book -- you are welcome to use any class resources / google -- but you may NOT discuss the exam with one another, or ASK questions on the internet (i.e. you may read materials on stackoverflow, but please do not post any new questions to help you answer the exam).
