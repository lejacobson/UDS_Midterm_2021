    "Tired of problem sets, you've recently decided to make your graduate school experience more interesting by starting your own business. After talking to a lot of classmates, you found that one of the things that they struggle with coming to Duke is having to leave behind their household pets. So your business idea: \"rent\" out pets to stressed-out students!\n",
    "\n",
    "![trillian_nose](images/trillian_nose.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the biggest problem with starting a business for college is that they're all broke. So rather than trying to market your service directly to students, you have approached the Duke Office of Health and Wellness to see if they'd be willing to pay for the service to improve student life. After all, not only is their mission to support student wellbeing, but paying for a student to spend an afternoon playing fetch with a lovely golden retriever is probably a *lot* cheaper than the therapy students who get overwhelmed might seek out, so it might even save them money in the long run!\n",
    "\n",
    "(Not the a dog is a substitute for a trained mental health professional when you need one! But sometimes an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure, and what could be a better preventative measure than cuddling a dog?!)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you sit down to chat with the folks at Health and Wellness (H&W) though, the seem very dubious about your proposal. In particular, they make the following argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There are actually quite a few students on campus who have pets. While pets are not generally allowed on campus, under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Fair House Act (FHA), we are required to make accomodations for students who have animals to assistant them with physical disabilities (\"service animals\"), and students who have animals to help them deal with mental health issue (\"emotional support animals\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "But in our experience, the students with these animals don't seem any happier than the average Duke student. Indeed, quite the contrary: they are some of the people who make use of Health and Wellness resources the most. We worry that while cute, animals on campus are actually turning into a distraction, causing students to lose focus on the studies, making them fall behind, and thus making them more stressed out then they would be otherwise. After all, if animals were so good at improving student mental health, it seems like the students with animals should be doing better than those without animals, and that's just not what we see!\""
