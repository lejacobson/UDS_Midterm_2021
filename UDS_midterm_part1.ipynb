    "- We can only make causal inferences when we can run experiments, but experiments are expensive and often difficult to implement.\n",
    "- We can never directly observe both an outcome under treatment and its counter-factual (outcome without treatment) for the same unit of observation at the same moment in time. Since we would have to be able to observe both an outcome and its counterfactual to be certain of the causal effect of any treatment, this means we can never be absolutely certain of our causal inferences. The best we can do is look for stand-ins we think *approximate* the counter-factual condition and use those to make inferences.\n",
